# About
This is Module 4 Challenge by the Ohio State University bootcamp. This project is about creating a Coding Quiz that records the user's high score.

## Description
When the user first entered the website, a 'View high scores' button on the top left can be used to check previous high scores by the top 10 record holders. Upon clicking on the 'Start Quiz' button, the user will be presented with 5 questions; Answering the questions correctly will bring the user to the next question, while the doing the opposite will reduce the quiz timer.
